                About Me
            </h2>
            <p class="about-details">Once a trained chef who wanted to broaden his perspective and hone new skills by learning coding in a fast-growing environment. 
                Blah blah blah currently writing content for this specific section of the code so there is a paragraph shape needed to test something out during the coding process. 
                Please do not mind the text passage as this will improve and change by the final product. Thank you! But just in case I need more text to write for this particular
                passage for my testing purposes. Here is more random text and stuff about myself that nobody will truly care about. Greatest thing in life is the joy of eating good food,
                without it I believe humans will have a significantly harder time to communicating with each other beyond body language. Food is a great way to experience one's culture while
                at the same time enjoy customs surrounding it. It's usually better than just walking around and sightseeing landmarks all day. Each culture has their own and it's a fascinating
                piece of history to be a part of. So one should be encourage to try different kinds of food to expand your own knowledge of the world. And that is my Tedtalk for today, thank you
                and have a wonderful day! Hope you enjoy my pointless talk about food and etc. on this weirdly worded passage. - Jung In Kim(James)</p>
